  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.5; font-family: monospace;">As an enthusiastic beginner in web development,
    I have a solid
    understanding of the basics of HTML and CSS. My
    journey started with creating simple, visually appealing web pages, focusing on structure and design. Eager to grow,
    I continuously practice and experiment with new techniques to enhance my skills. I actively seek out online
    resources and tutorials to expand my knowledge. Although I'm at the beginning of my web development career, I am
    passionate and determined to learn more and take on new challenges.</p>
